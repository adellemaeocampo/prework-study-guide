# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description


My motivation for this project was to build a tool that would aid me throughout the bootcamp while learning about programming languages and applications. It was built to help myself keep track of notes and content we learnt in the pre-modules and throughout the course. It ensures that I have a place to look back on and read through if I'm stuck at any point throughout this course. Through building this webpage i was able to learn the application of HTML, CSS and Javascript when building and designing a webpage in VS code. Additionally I was able to learn how to use the command line on my device and Git hub to keep track of changes throughout the project.
